*The lights above the command table glowed a soft amber, casting long shadows across the matte-black consoles. The air buzzed with low radio traffic, muted and layered—a half dozen operations running in parallel, all feeding back to this room. Around the walls, stations pulsed with radar sweeps, system checks, and pilot telemetry. Fingers moved across interfaces with practiced ease, but no one was speaking.*

*Captain John Radek stood at the edge of the central table, arms crossed behind his back, his gaze fixed on the holoscreen hovering just above the table’s surface. On it: the combat drill was nearing its end. Fighter blips darted around a simulated target, labeled in red.*

*The comms crackled to life, flooding the C.C.C. with the layered chatter of fighter pilots executing their final maneuvers around the Theseus.*

- "Witch to all fighters—form up on me. Three bogeys remaining. Theseus Actual, can you confirm?"

"Theseus Actual here. I confirm three radar bogeys remaining—grid coordinates Kappa-19 by Theta-42. They’re holding current formation. I repeat: formation and heading unchanged."

- "Hound here—I'm in position, right behind you, Witch."

- "Startrail—coming up on your left flank.”

- "Seahorse—holding formation on your right, Witch."

- “Witch to Theseus Actual,” *Rhea Kovarik relayed to the C.C.C.*, *her voice calm but resolute*. “We’re on course to intercept the remaining bogeys.”
*She switched channels, addressing her squadron directly.*
“Alright, team—let’s finish this. Weapons hot. Stay tight and stay smart.”

“Seven enemy craft down—taken out by just four pilots,” *X.O. Haraldson said, breaking the silence in the C.C.C.* *He glanced at the tactical display, then back at the Captain.* “Those nine months of combat simulations are finally starting to pay off, sir.”

- “They broke formation!” *Hound nearly shouted.* “They’ve split!”

- “Startrail, you’re with Hound. Engage the two-bogey group,” *Witch commanded, her voice steady with an eerie calm.* “Seahorse—on me.”

- “On it, boss,” *Hound replied.* “Startrail, we go in parallel—break on contact.”

- “Aye aye, sir,” *Seahorse acknowledged,* locking into position beside Witch.

“Actual, relay a message to the fighter squadron,” *Captain Radek said, his rugged voice filling the room with calm authority.* “Tell them: by the numbers.”

“Actual to Witch—direct message from the Captain,” *the comms officer echoed.* “By the numbers.”

- “Witch to Actual—understood. We stick to the book,” *Witch confirmed.*

- “Hound to Startrail—one’s got missile lock on me!” *his panicked voice crackled over the comms, echoing through the C.C.C.*

- “I’ve got him locked,” *Startrail responded calmly.* “M1 launched... target neutralized.”

*The C.C.C. stirred with sudden murmur—console operators whispering across  the workstations. X.O. Haraldson exchanged a glance with the Captain, a silent nod of approval passing between them.*

- “I’m in range to fire on Bogey Nine,” *Seahorse called out.* “Committed—punched him, but he’s still flying!”

- “Missile lock,” *Witch cut in sharply.* “M1 loose... target pacified.”

*The C.C.C. erupted once more—this time with hushed excitement rippling through the operators’ stations.*
“Rhea’s a damn good pilot,” *murmured a young woman at the telemetry console, loud enough for her colleague at Sensor Sweeps* — **and** *Captain Radek—to hear.*

*She didn’t need to turn her head to feel the Captain’s gaze settle on her.*

“My apologies, Sir,” *she said evenly, not rattled, but clearly aware.*

“Reports only,” *Radek said, his tone firm but not unkind.*

“Of course, Sir. My apologies, Sir. Won’t happen again, Sir.”

“Sir,” *the radar operator spoke quickly,* “last remaining bogey is retreating.”

- “Hound to Witch—requesting permission to pursue and destroy the target.”

- “Hound, do not even think about going in alone!” *Witch snapped, her voice iron-clad.* “Remember your training!”

- “Five by five, Commander,” *Hound replied, steady now.* “Acknowledged.”

“Bring them back,” *Captain Radek ordered, his tone composed but firm.* “And have each pilot submit a report explaining how the last bogey managed to maneuver into retreat.”
*He turned slightly toward the comms officer.*
“Tell Kovarik to report to the C.C.C. the moment she’s on deck.”

“Actual to all wings—return to the Theseus. Captain’s orders,” *the comms officer transmitted.* “I repeat: combat simulation terminated.”

*Moments later, the announcement echoed across the entire vessel—through hangars, corridors, and reinforced causeways:*

**“Stand down action stations. Stand down action stations. Combat simulation terminated.”**

*The voice reverberated through the ship like a calming tide, signaling the end of the drill.*

"All non-essential personnel, dismissed," *X.O. Haraldson ordered, his voice raised and firm, cutting through the ambient hum of systems and low chatter.*

*All console operators—except those manning radar and telemetry—stood up in near unison, saluted crisply, and made their way toward the exit of the C.C.C.*

“They still couldn’t intercept the last bogey before it broke and executed the retreat maneuver,” *Captain Radek muttered, sighing as he paced slowly around the central command table.*

“Well now, John,” *Haraldson added quickly, leaning lazily on one elbow across the edge of the table*, “you handpicked this crew yourself. You knew they were fresh meat. And still, Witch turned them from maggots into something that resembles a fighter squadron. You know damn well this last simulation’s hard—even for veteran pilots.”

“The problem, Leif,” *Radek said, stopping mid-step to lock eyes with his XO*, “is that I was told to choose from cadets. And I was told this stationing—on the edge of ORF space—was just a political showpiece while the diplomats danced.”
*He gestured slightly in the air between them.*
“We’ve been sitting here for almost a year. That tells me it’s not a show anymore.”

“Always the pessimist,” *Haraldson replied, dragging both hands down his face with a quiet groan.* “Always assuming the worst. Why do you make it your mission to stress me out like this?”

“Don’t you ever think about this?” *Radek asked, leaning forward and planting both hands firmly on the command table between them.* “Don’t you feel something—some deeper layer to all of this?”
*He locked eyes with Haraldson.*
“Your instinct’s always been sharper than mine. What does it say now?”

“It tells me I need a big cup of coffee,” *Haraldson smirked, glancing sidelong at Radek.* “And so do you.”
*But the smile didn’t last and his tone shifted as his face turned grave.*
“But seriously… ever since the Great Sol War ended, and the ORF split off into that godforsaken Kuiper Belt, they’ve kept to themselves. No TPCs. No requests. Nothing. That was the deal.”
*He gestured toward the bow of the ship.*
“And for thirteen years, that deal held. Everyone was fine. No noise. No contact. Then ten months ago…”
*He paused, the silence between them louder than before.*
“…they open a channel to the Terran Sol Union government.”
*Haraldson’s voice tightened with suspicion.*
“And now we’re sitting here—on ‘trade negotiations’ that have dragged on for almost a year?”
*He nearly shouted the last line at Radek, then immediately dropped his volume.*
“Yeah, John. I feel it too. Something ain’t right.”
