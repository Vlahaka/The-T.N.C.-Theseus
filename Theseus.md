*The lights above the command table glowed a soft amber, casting long shadows across the matte-black consoles. The air buzzed with low radio traffic, muted and layered—a half dozen operations running in parallel, all feeding back to this room. Around the walls, stations pulsed with radar sweeps, system checks, and pilot telemetry. Fingers moved across interfaces with practiced ease, but no one was speaking.*

*Captain John Radek stood at the edge of the central table, arms crossed behind his back, his gaze fixed on the holoscreen hovering just above the table’s surface. On it: the combat drill was nearing its end. Fighter blips darted around a simulated target, labeled in red.*

*The comms crackled to life, flooding the C.C.C. with the layered chatter of fighter pilots executing their final maneuvers around the Theseus.*

- "Witch to all fighters—form up on me. Three bogeys remaining. Theseus Actual, can you confirm?"

"Theseus Actual here. I confirm three radar bogeys remaining—grid coordinates Kappa-19 by Theta-42. They’re holding current formation. I repeat: formation and heading unchanged."

- "Hound here—I'm in position, right behind you, Witch."

- "Startrail—coming up on your left flank.”

- "Seahorse—holding formation on your right, Witch."

- “Witch to Theseus Actual,” *Rhea Kovarik relayed to the C.C.C.*, *her voice calm but resolute*. “We’re on course to intercept the remaining bogeys.”
*She switched channels, addressing her squadron directly.*
“Alright, team—let’s finish this. Weapons hot. Stay tight and stay smart.”

“Seven enemy craft down—taken out by just four pilots,” *X.O. Haraldson said, breaking the silence in the C.C.C.* *He glanced at the tactical display, then back at the Captain.* “Those nine months of combat simulations are finally starting to pay off, sir.”

- “They broke formation!” *Hound nearly shouted.* “They’ve split!”

- “Startrail, you’re with Hound. Engage the two-bogey group,” *Witch commanded, her voice steady with an eerie calm.* “Seahorse—on me.”

- “On it, boss,” *Hound replied.* “Startrail, we go in parallel—break on contact.”

- “Aye aye, sir,” *Seahorse acknowledged with an almost bored tone of voice.*

“Actual, relay a message to the fighter squadron,” *Captain Radek said, his rugged voice filling the room with calm authority.* “Tell them: by the numbers.”

“Actual to Witch—direct message from the Captain,” *the comms officer echoed.* “By the numbers.”

- “Witch to Actual—understood. We stick to the book,” *Witch confirmed.*

- “Hound to Startrail—one’s got missile lock on me!” *his panicked voice crackled over the comms, echoing through the C.C.C.*

- “I’ve got him locked,” *Startrail responded calmly.* “M1 launched... target neutralized.”

*The C.C.C. stirred with sudden murmur—console operators whispering across  the workstations. X.O. Haraldson exchanged a glance with the Captain, a silent nod of approval passing between them.*

- “I’m in range to fire on Bogey Nine,” *Seahorse called out.* “Committed—punched him, but he’s still flying!”

- “Missile lock,” *Witch cut in sharply.* “M1 loose... target pacified.”

*The C.C.C. erupted once more—this time with hushed excitement rippling through the operators’ stations.*
“Rhea’s a damn good pilot,” *murmured a young woman at the telemetry console, loud enough for her colleague at Sensor Sweeps* — **and** *Captain Radek—to hear.*

*She didn’t need to turn her head to feel the Captain’s gaze settle on her.*

“My apologies, Sir,” *she said evenly, not rattled, but clearly aware.*

“Reports only,” *Radek said, his tone firm but not unkind.*

“Of course, Sir. My apologies, Sir. Won’t happen again, Sir.”

“Sir,” *the radar operator spoke quickly,* “last remaining bogey is retreating.”

- “Hound to Witch—requesting permission to pursue and destroy the target.”

- “Hound, do not even think about going in alone!” *Witch snapped, her voice iron-clad.* “Remember your training!”

- “Five by five, Commander,” *Hound replied, steady now.* “Acknowledged.”

“Bring them back,” *Captain Radek ordered, his tone composed but firm.* “And have each pilot submit a report explaining how the last bogey managed to maneuver into retreat.”
*He turned slightly toward the comms officer.*
“Tell Kovarik to report to the C.C.C. the moment she’s on deck.”

“Actual to all wings—return to the Theseus. Captain’s orders,” *the comms officer transmitted.* “I repeat: combat simulation terminated.”

*Moments later, the announcement echoed across the entire vessel—through hangars, corridors, and reinforced causeways:*

**“Stand down action stations. Stand down action stations. Combat simulation terminated.”**

*The voice reverberated through the ship like a calming tide, signaling the end of the drill.*

"All non-essential personnel, dismissed," *X.O. Haraldson ordered, his voice raised and firm, cutting through the ambient hum of systems and low chatter.*

*All console operators—except those manning radar and telemetry—stood up in near unison, saluted crisply, and made their way toward the exit of the C.C.C.*

“They still couldn’t intercept the last bogey before it broke and executed the retreat maneuver,” *Captain Radek muttered, sighing as he paced slowly around the central command table.*

“Well now, John,” *Haraldson added quickly, leaning lazily on one elbow across the edge of the table*, “you handpicked this crew yourself. You knew they were fresh meat. And still, Witch turned them from maggots into something that resembles a fighter squadron. You know damn well this last simulation’s hard—even for veteran pilots.”

“The problem, Leif,” *Radek said, stopping mid-step to lock eyes with his XO*, “is that I was told to choose from cadets. And I was told this stationing—on the edge of ORF space—was just a political showpiece while the diplomats danced.”
*He gestured slightly in the air between them.*
“We’ve been sitting here for almost a year. That tells me it’s not a show anymore.”

“Always the pessimist,” *Haraldson replied, dragging both hands down his face with a quiet groan.* “Always assuming the worst. Why do you make it your mission to stress me out like this?”

“Don’t you ever think about this?” *Radek asked, leaning forward and planting both hands firmly on the command table between them.* “Don’t you feel something—some deeper layer to all of this?”
*He locked eyes with Haraldson.*
“Your instinct’s always been sharper than mine. What does it say now?”

“It tells me I need a big cup of coffee,” *Haraldson smirked, glancing sidelong at Radek.* “And so do you.”
*But the smile didn’t last and his tone shifted as his face turned grave.*
“But seriously… ever since the Great Sol War ended, and the ORF split off into that godforsaken Kuiper Belt, they’ve kept to themselves. No TPCs. No requests. Nothing. That was the deal.”
*He gestured toward the bow of the ship.*
“And for thirteen years, that deal held. Everyone was fine. No noise. No contact. Then one year ago…”,
*he paused, the silence in the room was countered by the hum of the instruments*,
“…they open a channel to the Terran Sol Union government.”
*Haraldson’s voice tightened with suspicion.*
“And now we’re sitting here—on ‘trade negotiations’ that have dragged on for almost a year?”
*He nearly shouted the last line at Radek, then immediately dropped his volume.*
“Yeah, John. I feel it too. Something ain’t right.”

*The door to the C.C.C. slid open before the XO could finish his last word.*

*Striding in with her usual confidence and a voice that needed no microphone*, *Rhea Kovarik declared:*
“Commander Kovarik callsign the Witch, reporting to the C.C.C. as requested, sir!”

*Radek and Haraldson turned toward her, returning her salute with a nod and matching formality.*

“At ease, Commander,” *Haraldson said, gently, one eyebrow arching with faint amusement.* “Just give us the feedback on your squad’s progress.”

“They’re improving, sir,” Kovarik *replied without hesitation*. “After more than 600 hours in combat simulations, they damn well ought to. They’re starting to operate as a unit—but they still slip into cocky impulses. Like Hound earlier.”
*She folded her arms.*
“In a real engagement, they might panic at first. But I’ve got the leash tight. If they lose it, I’ll snap them back into line.”

*Radek frowned slightly.*
“Why did you feel the need to extend your feedback into a live combat scenario? The war ended thirteen years ago, Commander.”

*Haraldson glanced at Radek, a small knowing smile on his face—wordless confirmation that the unease wasn’t just in the command deck. It had seeped into every corridor of the ship.*

“With all due respect, Captain,” *Kovarik began, inhaling deeply as if bracing herself*, “we’ve been stationed here for almost a year. I haven’t heard a single new directive from either of you—aside from the daily combat simulations. We’re preparing for something. We don’t know what, or when—but everyone on this ship feels it in their bones.”

“Sounds like you’re complaining,” *Haraldson cut in sharply, stepping toward her.*

“No, sir,” *Kovarik snapped into proper posture*. “I’m stating facts. It feels like the TSU is preparing for an offensive against the ORF—and we’re the tip of the spear.”

“Let her be, Leif,” *Radek interjected, a wide smile creeping onto his face*. “She’s right to speculate. We haven’t given out any new instructions because we haven’t received any. Just: hold position.”
*He stepped past her, heading toward the exit.*
“Now, let’s get that coffee you’ve been whining about.”

The two men stepped out of the C.C.C., while Kovarik remained rooted in place—like a computer left mid-task with no further input.

"Are you gonna sleep there, Kovarik?" *the X.O.'s voice rang out, echoing through the chamber.*

"No sir! On my way, sir!" *the Witch replied in a raised, eager tone and immediately quickened her pace to catch up with the two men.*

*As they walked through hallways, bulkheads, and causeways, every crew member they passed stopped in their tracks to offer firm, respectful salutes. Kovarik was clearly elated to be seen walking beside the ship’s Captain and Executive Officer.*

*Radek could feel her pride—and he remembered. Fifteen years ago, during the Great Sol War, she had joined his crew as a fresh academy graduate. Back then, she dreamed of becoming a great pilot, though her confidence was brittle. She had lost her family and friends to a bombing raid on her home dome on Mars. The only reason she survived was because she was still in Navy school on Earth.*

*After that, she flew with fury. She wanted to avenge her loss, to protect others from the same fate. It was Haradlson who shaped her into the pilot she had become—a razor-sharp ace who had survived countless dogfights on skill, instinct, and sheer will alone.*

“Heh, I can smell the coffee already,” *Haraldson blurted out, suddenly picking up his pace as he saw the cantina doors.*

*Radek turned his head toward Kovarik, a wide grin spreading across his face.*
“He **really** wanted that coffee, it seems.”

*The Witch let out a laugh, light and genuine—and for a moment, Radek felt the weight on his shoulders lift. Just for a few seconds.*

“Come on, let’s grab a bite,” *he said, nudging Kovarik forward.*

*As they reached the cantina entrance, the shift in atmosphere was palpable. Inside, the moment the crew spotted the XO stepping in, there was the scrape of chairs on metal floors and a near-synchronized, firm:*

**“Sir!”**

*The same sharp reaction echoed through the cantina the instant the captain stepped through the door. Chairs scraped again, boots shifted, and voices rang out in near-perfect unison:*

**“Sir!”**

“At ease, everyone!” *Haraldson barked, cutting through the salute before it could fully form.*

*Radek, stepping in behind him, gave a small wave of his hand.* “Sit down, carry on.”
*Then, turning toward Kovarik with a warm but confident tone, he gestured toward a row of empty seats near the far bulkhead.*
“Pick a spot for us. I’ll hit the coffee machine. You want one too, I assume?”

“Yes, sir. I’d appreciate a mug of coffee,” *she replied quickly, already moving toward the empty table with a practiced step.*

*At the coffee machine, Radek and Haraldson kept quiet—a strategic silence between them, not born of fatigue or disinterest, but of intention. They were scanning the cantina, ears tuned to the undercurrent of gossip and murmured speculation. It wasn’t curiosity—it was reconnaissance. The mood of a ship, after all, could be taken better from whispers than from reports.*

*As Radek poured steaming coffee into two metal mugs, he caught fragments of a hushed exchange at a table just a few meters to the left—four marines hunched close, heads low.*

"I’m telling you, the ORF is planning revenge on the TSU for losing the w—"
*One of them was abruptly cut off by the marine across from him.*
"The Outer Ring Factions are humans too," *he said sharply.* "They deserve a place in the damn solar system. It’s big enough for all of us."

*Haraldson met Radek’s gaze. A single glance. A slight nod. The kind of subtle exchange that signaled agreement: the marine’s logic was... difficult to argue with.*

*Radek took a metal tray from the stack nearby and placed three coffee mugs side by side.*
“I’ll go with these to the table. You bring some sandwiches—or whatever they’ve got,” *he said over his shoulder.*

*Haraldson growled something unintelligible in response, the kind of grumble that walked the line between mock annoyance and affection. Radek smirked, balancing the tray as he made his way through the cantina*.

*As he walked carefully between the tables, another low conversation caught his attention—this time between two medical staff seated near the corner bulkhead.*

“I was with Seahorse yesterday,” *one of the doctors murmured, cheeks flushing pink*. “And I must say, I’m not disappointed.”

“Really?” *the other blinked, clearly surprised.* “I heard from a solid source he’s crushing hard on his lead.”

*Radek arched an eyebrow but didn’t slow his pace. As curious as he was about this girly gossip, his mission was clear. He reached Kovarik’s table and lowered the tray gently, setting the mugs down one by one without spilling a drop.*

“What’s on your mind?” *Radek asked gently, noticing Kovarik staring into a fixed point.*

*She didn’t look at him when she spoke.*
“Sir… do you remember? Thirteen years ago, the final minutes of the Sol War?”
*Her voice softened, the edges tinged with something between nostalgia and unease.*
“When we had our guns locked on the Neptunic Militia fighters… I still remember your voice, steady over the radio, keeping us calm. All of us, finger on the trigger, and you kept saying—‘Do not fire unless fired upon. Wait. Wait.’ Over and over.”

*Radek paused, his mug halfway to his lips. The memory hit him like a brief static charge*.
“Ah... yeah. I remember. Why bring that up now?”

“Bring what up?” *Haraldson’s voice cut in casually as he was taking a seat the table, placing a tray of sandwiches down with a familiar thud. He glanced between them, sensing something deeper had just passed beneath the surface.*

“Well,” *Radek said, looping Haraldson into the moment,* “our young squadron lead is feeling a bit nostalgic about the final minutes of the Sol War.”

“Ah… I see,” *Haraldson nodded as he slid into his seat, picking up on the weight in the air*. “What about it, Kovarik?”

*She stared into her coffee for a moment, then looked up, eyes steady*.
“I wanted to say… back then, I wanted to kill every last one of those bastards. Personally.”
*Her expression shifted—nostalgia giving way to the ghost of old rage, then cooling into blank calm*.
“But now… I keep trying to summon that same fire toward the ORF, and it’s just not there anymore. I don’t feel it. Not like I used to.”

*Radek shifted his gaze to Haraldson—an unspoken cue that this part of the conversation was the XO’s domain.*

*Catching the signal, Haraldson cleared his throat and leaned forward slightly.*
"Listen, Rhea," *he began, voice steady but softened*, "we’re all soldiers here. We follow orders. Even those guys in the Sol War... they were just following theirs."
*He looked down at his coffee mug, the steam swirling like faint ghosts of memory.*
"We all carry skeletons," *he said, more quietly now*. "That’s the life we signed up for. A soldier’s life. We live with it."
*Then he raised his eyes to meet hers.*
"The fact that your thirst for vengeance is gone—it doesn’t make you weak. It means you’ve learned to live again."

*Kovarik nodded slowly, her mouth parting to reply, but she was cut off by shouting from beyond the cantina door.*

"XO Haraldson! Sir, there’s a—XO Harald—!”
*A young lieutenant burst through the entrance, eyes wide, breath ragged as he scanned the room.*

“Message, sir! Urgent message from Navy Command!”

“I’m here, boy,” *Haraldson called out, standing halfway from his seat.* “What’s with the theatrics? Did you forget your training?”

“No, sir!” *the lieutenant straightened into a rigid posture, voice loud and crisp now.* “Message marked for immediate delivery to Theseus Command Staff. No delay permitted, sir!”

*Haraldson stepped forward, already extending a hand.*
“Dismissed, Lieutenant,” *he said calmly as he took the sealed paper*.

*Radek and Kovarik watched as Haraldson sat down heavily, the paper in hand. He huffed, puffed, and let out a low, animal growl from deep in his throat*.

**“It’s bad, John**,” *he muttered grimly, sliding the message across the table*. **“It’s very bad.”**

*Every eye in the cantina was locked on the command staff’s table. Conversations had ceased. Breaths were held.*

*Radek took the paper without a word and began reading—deliberately slow. He could feel the heat rising in his face, jaw tightening with each line.*

> **To the Theseus Command Staff,**
>
> Following the negotiations between the TSU and the ORF, the T.N.C. Theseus is hereby ordered to depart immediately upon receipt of this T.P.C.

> Coordinates: [KX-287.94 / 09°N - 132°W / 41.7 AU]
>
> Rendezvous with an Outer Ring Faction fleet is to occur at the specified coordinates. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure the safe escort and extraction of all vessels currently within ORF territory at that location. 
>
> Intelligence reports indicate the destruction of multiple ORF ships and stations by an unidentified vessel not originating from the Sol system.

> Departure is to be confirmed via T.P.C. with Navy Command and executed without delay.
>
> **Godspeed.**

*Radek folded the paper slowly, pressing each crease with deliberate weight, as if trying to contain the message within it. For a long moment, he kept his eyes down. Only when the silence stretched unbearably did he lift his gaze to meet Haraldson’s.*

"Clear the cantina," *he said, his voice low, almost hoarse—like the words had scraped their way out.*

*Without hesitation, the X.O. turned on his heel, voice erupting like a thunderclap that shook the air and steel alike.*

"All personnel—on your feet and back to your posts! Move, you lazy bastards!"

*In an instant, the cantina erupted into motion. Chairs scraped back, trays clattered, and startled shouts echoed off steel walls. Glasses shattered, drinks spilled, and half-eaten meals were abandoned. The crew moved with practiced chaos—every one of them—and even the Witch gave a sharp salute before disappearing into the exodus.*

*Silence fell again, heavy and sudden.*

"Well, John..." *Haraldson’s voice cut through the stillness, deeper and more solemn than Radek had ever heard.* "...can you tell me what the hell **not of Sol origin** is supposed to mean?"

*Radek shook his head slowly, his voice carrying a restrained edge*. "I know as much as you do, Leif. But one thing’s clear—we’ve just been ordered into ORF territory. Thirteen years of silence, and now we’re the first ones to cross the line."

*He leaned forward, placing his elbows on the table, rubbing his eyes with his palms like he was trying to press sense into the situation*. "I think it’s safe to assume the negotiations are over."

*Haraldson’s voice rose—not in panic, but in conviction*. "They’re sending us in blind, John. What if this is a trap? What if the ORF's playing dead just long enough to seize Command’s most advanced ship?"

*He paused, staring into Radek’s eyes*.

"If it comes to it—if we’re outgunned, surrounded—we can’t let them take the Theseus. We destroy her. We all go down with her if we must. But they don’t get her. Not a scrap."

“This is what we signed up for, Leif. And besides,” *Radek added with a tempered voice,* “we’ve faced worse odds than this.” *He stood straighter*. “So what are we waiting for? Give the order.”

“Aye, aye, Sir,” *Haraldson replied without hesitation, turning briskly toward the nearest hardline terminal mounted on the cantina wall. He picked up the receiver, voice clear and proud as steel.*

“Action Stations! Set Condition Two throughout the ship. Initiate alignment to ORF Staging Outpost. Prepare Impulse Jump Protocols.”

*The very moment he hung up, the deck beneath them began to thrum—a low, powerful vibration spreading through the cantina like a pulse of restrained thunder.*

**"ACTION STATIONS, ACTION STATIONS—THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ALL HANDS TO YOUR POSTS. CONDITION TWO IS SET. IMPULSE JUMP PROTOCOL INITIATED."**

*Radek, already in motion toward the exit, glanced sideways at Haraldson with a half-smile.*
“You never get tired of that part, do you?”

*Haraldson gave a proud shrug as he fell in beside him.*
“Some perks never lose their shine. Let’s get back to the C.C.C.”

*Even before stepping outside the cantina, the two commanders could already hear the surge of movement. Alarms blared. Yellow warning lights pulsed through the corridors in steady, stuttering flashes. Crew members stormed past in all directions, focused, driven—none stopping to salute. It was as if the captain and XO had become just another part of the machinery in motion.*

*Radek and Haraldson moved quickly, pacing hard toward the C.C.C. when the overhead speakers erupted again*:

**"Captain and Executive Officer—report to Command and Communication Center immediately."**

*Radek caught a voice in passing—one of the crew, panicked and breathless:*
**“What THE FUCK IS GOING On?”**

*Neither commander responded. They pressed forward, urgency carving lines into their faces.*

*Haraldson sidestepped a pair of crewmen wheeling a cart overloaded with interceptor parts, grinning like a man finally released from stillness*.

“Finally, this ship is alive,” *he said, eyes scanning the blur of movement.*

“I must admit, Leif,” *Radek replied between breaths*, “after so long being parked in the middle of… nothing—it does look like we’re pumping blood again.”

*Both men stormed into the C.C.C.—and chaos greeted them like a tidal wave*.

*The acting officer rushed to intercept Radek, weaving through the blur of shouting, overlapping chatter, console alarms, and printers spewing reams of data*.

"Sir—gravitational arrays are detecting fifty-two ERBs forming all over our location—they’ll be here in—"

*He was cut off as the speakers cracked to life with a surge of radio chatter from engineering:*

- “Impulse core is now engaged. All metrics green on our side. Actual, confirm order to begin Einstein-Rosen bridge formation!”

*Radek turned instinctively toward the nearest hardline, but another voice broke through—the telemetry  operator:*

“Captain! Fifty-two bogeys on scope, they are all ORF. Orders, sir?”

*Before Radek could respond, Haraldson slammed a fist into the command table. His voice roared over the din:*

"Silence! This is the C.C.C.! You are trained Navy personnel—act like it! Or I swear, I’ll personally throw every last one of you into the brig!"

The room fell into sudden, brittle silence. Only the soft whine of alarms and the rapid ticking of printers remained.

"Give me full ID on the 52 ships. Cancel the impulse jump. Set Condition One across the ship," *Radek ordered, his voice steady but razor-sharp as he took full command of the C.C.C.*

*The tactical officer responded, eyes glued to the display.* "Sir, the ORF fleet appears to be entirely civili—"

*Before he could finish, the ship-wide alert cut him off:*

"ALL HANDS: BRACE FOR ACTIVE COMBAT. CONDITION ONE IS SET. LIVE AMMUNITION HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED."

*Radek’s eyes narrowed.* "No military craft in that fleet? Confirm that."

*The tactical post snapped back,* "Yes, sir. Fifty-two vessels. Civilian only—no visible weapons, no tactical formations."

*The comms lit up again with engineering:*
- "Actual, confirm impulse jump abort. Repeat—confirm abort."

*Haraldson leaned over the comms station and locked eyes with the trembling lieutenant manning the channel.*

"Son..." *his voice dropped to a gravelly growl*, "are you going to make them wait for confirmation while we’re staring down fifty unarmed ships?"

"No sir. Yes sir!" *the lieutenant snapped back into reality.*
"Actual here—aborting impulse jump. Impulse protocols standing down."

*As the tension in the room began to settle, a new flood burst through the comms—the radio chatter from all 52 ORF ships, overlapping, desperate, chaotic, each transmission cutting in and out, voices trembling:*

- "Thank god you’re here..."
- "We... were... hundreds..."
- "They... while we tried to evac..."
- "All military stayed behi—"
- "One... unknown craft..."
- "Thousands dead..."

*Radek lifted his head from the glowing grid of the command table, frowning as the overlapping bursts of garbled comms fed through the speakers like a dozen voices screaming underwater. He scanned the room. Every officer in the C.C.C. had frozen mid-task, posture rigid, eyes darting between monitors and each other.*

*Panic wasn’t visible to the naked eye — it vibrated in the air.*

*The cacophony of civilian transmissions continued: fragmented phrases, desperate voices, all colliding into one unintelligible wall of noise. Some pleaded. Some screamed. One repeated the same word again and again:* “burning... burning... burning...”

*Radek’s jaw tensed. His sight locked onto the tactical officer, who sat clenched at his station with his hands gripping tightly to the edges of the console.*

*Radek’s eyes sharpened. He straightened and gave a single, cold order:*
"Jam all communications. All frequencies. All ships. Now."

"Aye Aye Sir", *operator from Tactical console snapped hastily*, "All comms jammed for all ORF fleet". 

*The C.C.C. had fallen into an unnatural silence. Even the usual hums and mechanical whirs of the consoles seemed to have quieted, as if the ship itself was holding its breath. For a brief moment, no one spoke. Operators glanced at one another, then back to their screens—some visibly sweating, others frozen mid-motion. Radek could feel the air thickening, dense with the sound of dozens of people breathing faster than normal, tension radiating like static. The air conditioning blew a faint stream of cold air across his neck, a mechanical whisper against the rising pressure.*

*This stillness was historic.*

*Since the Theseus was commissioned, not once had Condition 1 been initiated in a live context. This was no drill. Outside the C.C.C., muffled noise still leaked through—metal boots pounding on deck, tools being moved, shouted orders as the rest of the ship raced to their posts.*

*Then, cutting cleanly through the tension, Radek’s voice:*
“Ship-wide systems check—report now.”

*Haraldson was already moving toward the hardline terminal on the far side of the command table before Radek had even finished giving the order.*
“On it,” *he muttered, picking up the receiver with one hand while locking eyes with the communications lieutenant. The officer gave a sharp nod.*

*Haraldson turned slightly, speaking into the mic with calm, steady authority that cut clean across the tense air*:

**“All hands, this is XO Haraldson. Stand by for ship-wide systems check.”**

*His voice echoed through every corridor, room, hall, and bay of the Theseus.*

*Haraldson swept his eyes across the C.C.C., mic lowered to his chest.*

“Navigation.”

“Go,” *came the sharp reply.*

“Tactical.”

“Go.”

“Telemetry.”

“Go.”

“Radar.”

“Go.”

“Astrometrics.”

“Go.”

“Comms.”

“Go.”

*He raised the mic again.*
“Engineering.”
- “Standing by,” *the radio crackled*.

“Fighter Bay.”
- “Standing by,” *the Witch’s voice rang through*.

“Interceptor Bay.”
- “Standing by,” *came a gravelly response.*

“Logistics.”
- “Standing by, Sir,” *a slightly distorted voice affirmed.*

“Medbay.”
- “Ready.” *Calm. Confident.*

*Haraldson glanced at the captain and gave a firm nod.*
“Theseus is locked and loaded, Sir. Condition 1 is in full effect.”
